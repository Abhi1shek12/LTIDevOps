Overview DevOps: DevOps -> Devlopment + operations - It is a Culture to promote devlopment and operations work collectively. Devlopment -> devlopers, testers operations -> 
support engg, system engg , network engineer (to make all the confiuration to be available on respective environment)
 - cultural change , approach - To overcome the challenges being faced in agile.  - DevOps one step ahead of agile process, DevOps makes the product delivery is fast than agile.
 - DevOPs team should have knowlege on various automation tools like Git, Jenkins, maven, Junit, TestNG, Selenium etc 
- Automate everything, right from devlopment, testing, deploy the build on prouction in faster and repeatable way. 

req/user stories/enhancement/feedback --> devoper writes the code -->testing -->deploy app on production Why DevOps? 1. To make devlopment & operations team to work together

2. without Devops, team may spend larger amount of time for devlopment, testing, design and deployment. After we introduced with Devops, time we spend for the project is ver less.

3. Manually deploying the code on the production server, leads to human errors in production 
Key Features of DevOps

1. Automation

2. Colloboration

3. Integration Jenkins(continuous integration server) devlopment (code)--> code gets converted into jar/war file --> war file deployed on testing server -> testing team access the application and test it. build1 changes build1+changes 4. Configuration management DevOps Architecture: plan -> devlop -> deploy build -> test -> releaes -> monitor--> repeatable way


Difference betweeb Agile & DevOps & traditional Model
